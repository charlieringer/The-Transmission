E4: What do we do?
CENTRAL: I don't know. I need to find out what's going on from the rest. 
E4: I'm going to lose it man, everyone's going to fucking die. 
CENTRAL: Keep your shit together. 
E4: Man fuck you, we're not all fucking ice cold like you
CENTRAL: This is an incident so COMMAND is going to read all this. 
CENTRAL: I'm just looking out for you, I'm scared too.
E4: Sorry man
E4: Look, get in touch with the others. 
E4: I'm going to see if I can find anything else from the guys deployed here.
CENTRAL: Ok. Stay safe.
