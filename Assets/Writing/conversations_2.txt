E4: CENTRAL, what the fuck is going on?
E4: I don't need to be dealing with this shit man
CENTRAL: You think I do? Shit. 
CENTRAL: The detection is coming from S0. I can't connect to them. 
CENTRAL: Have you got anything from your SatNet Alsys? 
E4: Fucking nothing man
E4: What do we do?
CENTRAL: I don't know. I need to find out what's going on from the rest. 
E4: I'm going to lose it man, everyone's going to fucking die. 
CENTRAL: Keep your shit together. 
E4: Man fuck you, we're not all fucking ice cold like you
CENTRAL: This is an incident so COMMAND is going to read all this. 
CENTRAL: I'm just looking out for you, I'm scared too.
E4: Sorry man
E4: Look, get in touch with the others. 
E4: I'm going to see if I can find anything else from the guys deployed here.
CENTRAL: Ok. Stay safe.
E4: You too man.

W3: This is Sat-W3 receiving your transmission. All systems confirmed live and ALsys returning insignificant. 
W3: Glory to the empire
W3: Hey CENTRAL, do you know what's going on with this alert?
W3: You got in touch with S0 right?
CENTRAL: No. He's not responding.
W3: Oh man, oh man
W3: My Alsys is not reporting anything
W3: We're going to be okay right?
CENTRAL: I don't know. 
CENTRAL: Did you get in touch with S0 at all?
W3: Only after your rounds. We talked for a bit and that was it.
CENTRAL: He didn't say anything was up?
W3: Only his terminal, said it was playing up.
W3: Sometimes his transmission would lock up
W3: And a whole chain of messages would appear at once
W3: You know, typical antiquated shit from this equipment
W3: I didnt think itd be serious
CENTRAL: It's plenty serious
W3: Oh fuck man
W3: Is there anything I can do?
CENTRAL: No, keep an eye on your Alsys and check around with others if they can spot anything. 
CENTRAL: It's a longshot though. 
CENTRAL: Let's hope it's nothing. 
W3: Damn, okay. Let's hope so. 
CENTRAL: Stay safe.
W3: You too bossman.

COMMAND: This is COMMAND, receiving from SatNet-CENTRAL. Your communication lines are free. 
COMMAND: What the fuck is going on CENTRAL? 
COMMAND: The generals are preparing for a retaliation.
COMMAND: They are suspicious that you have not enacted the retaliation policy.  
CENTRAL: They're going to read this
COMMAND: We can worry about that later. What have you found?
CENTRAL: I'm not sure. S0 isn't responding, and we don't know where the projectile is coming from or where it's going.
CENTRAL: It's a mess out here. We need to run takeover protocol on S0's satellites. 
CENTRAL: Can you approve?
COMMAND: Roger. 
COMMAND: Okay, go ahead and connect to S0 now, they should be unlocked and free access. 
COMMAND: Hurry, their line is not secure until you get in. 
COMMAND: You can initiate with 'SatNet.pto Sn/U/TH'
CENTRAL: Roger, trying now. 
>SatNet.pto Sn/U/TH 
>SatNet takeover protocol error 
>takeover key input missing
CENTRAL: Command, I'm getting an error here. It's asking for a key 
COMMAND: Hold on. 
CENTRAL: Okay. 
COMMAND: Their terminal is not responding to our overwrites.
COMMAND: You will need to contact the others and ask for the S0 manual override key. 
COMMAND: We will push it up to your main panels to speed things up
COMMAND: Get to the bottom of this CENTRAL, hurry.
COMMAND: For the glory of the empire. 
CENTRAL: Roger.
