N0: man i bet you look hot when youre stressed out
CENTRAL: I'm not fucking around right now, have you heard anything from S0? 
N0: mmmmm
N0: nah, nothing on my end
N0: its just one projectile right? 
N0: you know it might be a false alarm?
CENTRAL: It might be, or we might all be about to die.

CENTRAL: You're part of this too, get serious for a minute
N0: i am. look i dont think you should be freaking out just yet
N0: its only S0 alerting the SatNet right now
N0: and its only one projectile
N0: you think the first initiation would be this small?
N0: youre the one in charge of the rest of us, and you need to stay calm
N0: because whatever you do, command is going to be on all our asses 
N0: for now we need to confirm between us if this is really happening before the bosses get involved
CENTRAL: Yeah. Okay.
N0: im guessing you cant get in touch with S0
CENTRAL: Got nothing from them. 
N0: wonderful
N0: ask command about the takeover protocol 
CENTRAL: I know about that. Wait, where did you learn that?
