W3: Glory to the empire
W3: Hey CENTRAL, do you know what's going on with this alert?
W3: You got in touch with S0 right?
CENTRAL: No. He's not responding.
W3: Oh man, oh man
W3: My Alsys is not reporting anything
W3: We're going to be okay right?
CENTRAL: I don't know. 
CENTRAL: Did you get in touch with S0 at all?
W3: Only after your rounds. We talked for a bit and that was it.
CENTRAL: He didn't say anything was up?
W3: Only his terminal, said it was playing up.
W3: Sometimes his transmission would lock up
W3: And a whole chain of messages would appear at once
W3: You know, typical antiquated shit from this equipment
W3: I didnt think itd be serious
CENTRAL: It's plenty serious
W3: Oh fuck man
W3: Is there anything I can do?
CENTRAL: No, keep an eye on your Alsys and check around with others if they can spot anything. 
CENTRAL: It's a longshot though. 
CENTRAL: Let's hope it's nothing. 
W3: Damn, okay. Let's hope so. 
CENTRAL: Stay safe.
W3: You too bossman.
