E4: Hello?
N0: well this is interesting
W3: Hi everyone, is there news on the alert?
COMMAND: CENTRAL, have you managed to override S0?
CENTRAL: Hi, yes. 
CENTRAL: We have a problem
CENTRAL: After connecting to S0's satellites, my Alsys is reporting another 3 launches.
CENTRAL: Things don't look very good. 
COMMAND: Roger.
E4: Oh my god 
E4: More of them?
W3: Then this is real...
COMMAND: We didn't receive any SatNet wide alerts
COMMAND: Can we confirm it is only detected by S0? 
N0: nothing on my end
E4: I have nothing on my Alsys
W3: Me neither...
CENTRAL: Then we need to figure out what we're going to do here.
CENTRAL: Command, is there a way to dispatch an emergency crew to S0? 
COMMAND: Negative
COMMAND: Even if we could, it would take approximately four hours
COMMAND: And they may not be able to resolve anything
COMMAND: CENTRAL, I think it is time to enact the retaliation protocol
E4: Man fuck all of this
E4: I don't want to be the only ones to fucking die
E4: Do it 
N0: well hold on
W3: I want to go back home
W3: If we're going to die, I want to be with my family
CENTRAL: Are there no orders from above?
COMMAND: No. Only concerns and questions of why you have not done anything yet
N0: haha
N0: everyone has deferred responsibility to you
CENTRAL: Great
E4: Why are you laughing at this?
E4: Take your shit seriously 
N0: as a matter of fact, i do
N0: honey, its your call but something feels awful wrong about this
CENTRAL: I know
W3: What?
W3: What do you mean?
N0: even with four targets you dont think that this is a bit small?
N0: for a first strike i certainly wouldnt hold back
CENTRAL: No kidding
E4: This is just conjecture
E4: We don't have time for this 
N0: we have all the time
N0: if its real, we will die soon enough
N0: if it isnt, we will find out in the morning
W3: We have a duty
W3: We cant let our people down
E4: Damn right, if we have to die, we fucking make sure that then they do too
COMMAND: Central, you need to respond
COMMAND: Now
COMMAND: We have already enacted our end of the authentification process 
COMMAND: You have clearance to retaliate
N0: you people really bought all that bullshit huh?
E4: Fuck you
W3: It's gotta be real now, how couldn't it be
