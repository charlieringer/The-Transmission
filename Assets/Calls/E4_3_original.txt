E4: This is Sat-E4 receiving your transmission. All systems confirmed live, ALsys has nothing significant. 
E4: What's the news Central?
E4: Is it real? 
Central: I still don't know. Listen, we need to override access to S0
Central: The key is hashed between the other stations. I need you to pull yours up for me. 
E4: Oh okay
E4: How?
E4: Fuck man I'm sweating buckets 
E4: What if it's real? The fuck are we going to do? 
Central: Calm down
Central: Enter 'SatNet.pto.key Sn/U/TH'
E4: It's 8334 
Central: Thanks 
E4: Look man I hope you figure this shit out
E4: I know we're piling it all on you but we can't do shit over here
Central: Thanks for reminding me.
E4: Is there anything else I can do?
Central: No, nothing
E4: Man I feel helpless
Central: We all do. 
Central: I'm going to get the other keys now 
E4: Okay, okay. 
E4: Good luck 
E4: Can you get back to me if you find anything out please?
