>SatNet.transmit E4
E4: This is Sat-E4 receiving your transmission. All systems confirmed live, ALsys insignificant. Glory to the empire. 
CENTRAL: Evening. 
E4: Hey Central. How's it going?
CENTRAL: It's not. That's how we like things, right?
E4: Haha, sure sure. 
E4: I know you're just doing your rounds but I like having someone checking in on me.
CENTRAL: You can contact anyone you want you know. 
E4: Yeah, but it's not quite the same thing. Besides, we can't transmit to you unless something goes wrong... 
E4: There's only 5 of us as it is. 
CENTRAL: I'm sure I'm not that nice to talk to anyway. 
CENTRAL: We're lucky to have 4 colleagues we get along with. 
E4: And we get paid nicely!
CENTRAL: That's for drinking up all the propaganda. 
E4: They can read this you know...
CENTRAL: I do my job fine, and that's what matters. 
CENTRAL: I need to check in on the others now. I'll catch up with you later. 
E4: Alright, let's talk later.

S0: Lay off, I'm joking lol. 
S0: I know you're only nice to me anyway, best friend!
CENTRAL: Imma close the transmission and carry on with my rounds.
S0: HAHA HEY WAIT WAIT
CENTRAL: What 
S0: Actually, I need to be serious for a minute. My terminal's been freezing a bit today. 
CENTRAL: So same as usual?
S0: No man, something is fucky. I'm not sure what the trigger is, we've been trying to diagnose it all day. 
S0: But the engineers have all gone home so we're SOL until the morning. 
CENTRAL: I'll note this in my comments. Should be fine, no big deal. 
S0: Alright bud. Appreciate it.
CENTRAL: It's my job.
S0: Yeah yeah.
S0: Hey, you want to go somewhere tomorrow? 
CENTRAL: Why?
S0: I dunno, it's our last shift for the week. 
CENTRAL: We're quite far away from each other, meeting up is a pain...
S0: Come on man
CENTRAL: I'll think about it. 
S0: You're such an ass. Get going then. 
CENTRAL: I'm perfectly pleasant, thank you. I'll get back to you in a bit.

N0: does it matter?

CENTRAL: Maybe. 
N0: get money and get out
N0: thats as far as ive thought about it

W3: Aaaaah. Yeah, you're right.
W3: Sorry, Im still getting the hang of all this. 
W3: Hey, am I always the last satellite you check in with? 
CENTRAL: Dunno. I guess not.
CENTRAL: I'm pretty arbitrary with the order I contact you guys, I guess?
W3: I always wondered. Isn't there a protocol for that stuff? 
CENTRAL: I guess not. 
W3: Hey hey, no matter right? I was just wondering.
CENTRAL: You're the one asking me...
W3: Yeah.
W3: Hey, what do you do when you're not doing rounds? 
W3: You're allowed to chat to the others right?
W3: It isn't like with us, where you have others around you
W3: You know, physically
CENTRAL: Hm 
CENTRAL: I'm allowed to contact the others if I want to.
